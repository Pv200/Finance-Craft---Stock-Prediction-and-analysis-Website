    <h1 class="heading">OVERVIEW OF THE STOCK MARKET</h1>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">What is Stock Market?</h3>
    <p class="para1">A stock market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks, which represent ownership claims on businesses;
        these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private
        companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind.
        There are two major stock exchanges in India namely National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). </p>
    <h4 id="sizegraph">Size of the Indian Stock Market</h4>
    <img class="Graph1" src="/images/sizeofstockmarketGRAPH.jpg">
    <br>
    <h3 id="rankings">World Rankings of the Stock Market</h3>
    <img class="Graph2" src="/images/Rankings.jpg">
    <br>
    <p class="para2">According to the National Stock Exchange, the market capitalization of the stock market is of 3.61 trillion Dollars. </p>
    <h2 class="functions"># Funtions and Purposes</h2>
    <p class="para3">
        <ol class="pt1">• The stock market is a component of a free-market economy. It allows companies to raise money by offering stock shares and corporate bonds and allows investors to participate in the financial achievements of the companies, make profits through capital gains, and earn income through dividends. The stock market works as a platform through which savings and investments of individuals are efficiently channelled into productive investment opportunities and add to the capital formation and economic growth of the country.</ol>
        <ol class="pt1">• The stock market ensures price transparency, liquidity, price discovery, and fair dealings in trading activities. The stock market guarantees all interested market participants have access to data for all buy and sell orders, thereby helping in the fair and transparent pricing of securities. The market also ensures efficient matching of appropriate buy and sell orders.</ol>
        <ol class="pt1">• Stock markets need to support price discovery where the price of any stock is determined collectively by all of its buyers and sellers. Those qualified and willing to trade should get instant access to place orders and the market ensures that the orders are executed at a fair price.</ol> 
    </p>
    <h2 class="shares">What are shares ? </h2>
    <br>
    <img class="sh2" src="/images/shares.jpg" alt="shares of stock market">
    <br>
    <p>
        <ul id="s1">Shares are units of ownership in a company. The terms "shares" and "stocks" are often used interchangeably, but they represent a company differently. For example, say XYZ company issued stock and you purchased 10 shares of it. If each share represents 1% of ownership, you own 10% of the company. The company issued stock, and you bought shares of it.</ul>
        <ul id="s1">When establishing a corporation, owners may choose to issue stock to raise capital. Companies then divide their stock into shares, which are sold to investors. These investors are generally investment banks or brokers that, in turn, sell the shares to other investors individually or through instruments like a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund.</ul>
        <ul id="s1">Shares are the equivalent of ownership in a corporation. Because they represent ownership, not debt, there is no legal obligation for the company to reimburse the shareholders if something happens to the business.</ul>

    <div>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" style="position: relative;">Intraday Trading</h2>
        <ol id="TStyle">
            •Intraday means "within the day." In the financial world, the term is shorthand used to describe securities that trade on the markets during regular business hours. These securities include stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
            <br>
            <br>
            •Intraday also signifies the highs and lows that the asset crossed throughout the day. Intraday price movements are particularly significant to short-term or day traders looking to make multiple trades over the course of a single trading session. These busy traders will settle all their positions when the market closes.
            <br>
            <br>
            •Traders pay close attention to intraday price movements by using real-time charts in an attempt to benefit from short-term price fluctuations. Short-term traders typically use one-, five-, 15-, 30- and 60-minute intraday charts when trading within the market day. Typically, intraday scalping uses one- and five-minute charts for high-speed trading. Other intraday trading strategies may use 30- and 60-minute charts for trades that have hold times of several hours. Scalping is a strategy of transacting many trades per day that hopes to profit from small movements in a stock's price. The intraday trader may hold their positions for a longer period but still operate under high risks.

        <ol id="TStyle">
            •Futures and options are the major types of stock derivatives trading in a share market. These are contracts signed by two parties for trading a stock asset at a predetermined price on a later date. Such contracts try to hedge market risks involved in stock market trading by locking in the price beforehand.
            <br>
            <br>
            •Future and options in the share market are contracts which derive their price from an underlying asset (known as underlying), such as shares, stock market indices, commodities, ETFs, and more. Futures and options basics provide individuals to reduce future risk with their investment through pre-determined prices. However, since a direction of price movements cannot be predicted, it can cause substantial profits or losses if a market prediction is inaccurate. Typically, individuals well versed with the operations of a stock market primarily participate in such trades.

The primary goal of long-term investing is to build wealth gradually, taking advantage of the power of compounding.

        <ol class="CB1">
            •A circuit breaker is a regulatory measure that temporarily suspends trading on an exchange. Circuit breakers are pre-defined percentage values that check for uncontrolled movement in a security or index in either direction. These values are compared with previous closing levels of an index or security.
            <br>
            <br>
            •In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India is responsible for the formulation and monitoring of the circuit breaker mechanism. Index-based market-wide circuit limits were set up in July 2001. Some modifications were made in September 2013.
            <br>
            <br>
            •Stocks are driven by sentiment and tend to fluctuate in case of positive and negative news. Negative news may cause the stock price to fall beyond a certain level which can cause fear among investors. The bulk sale of shares may lead the market to crash. Hence, a circuit breaker mechanism is set up to eliminate extreme price movements and curb price manipulation.

            •Risk management is a systematic process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with an activity or investment. The main objective of risk management is to minimize the potential impact of risks on an investment portfolio while maximizing its returns.
            <br>
            <br>
            •Risk management in stock market involves a comprehensive approach that considers various factors that can impact an investment portfolio. These factors may include market trends, economic conditions, political events, and company performance, among others.
            <br>
            <br>
            •Risk management helps cut down losses. It can also help protect traders' accounts from losing all of its money. The risk occurs when traders suffer losses. If the risk can be managed, traders can open themselves up to making money in the market.

        <h3 class="IB2">How does Risk Management work?</h3>
        <ol class="RM2">
            Risk management works by identifying potential risks, assessing their likelihood and potential impact, and implementing strategies to mitigate or avoid those risks. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The risk management process typically involves several steps:
            <br>
            <br>
            1.    Risk Identification: The first step in the risk management process is to identify potential risks that may affect the investment portfolio. This can be done through various methods, such as historical data analysis, market research, or expert opinions.
            <br>
            <br>
            2.    Risk Assessment: Once the potential risks have been identified, they are assessed based on their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on the investment portfolio. This step involves analysing the severity of the risk and the probability of its occurrence.
            <br>
            <br>
            3.    Risk Evaluation: After the risks have been assessed, they are evaluated based on their priority and importance. This step involves determining which risks are the most critical and require immediate attention.
            <br>
            <br>
            4.    Risk Treatment: The final step in the risk management process is to implement strategies to mitigate or avoid the identified risks. This can be done through various techniques, such as diversification, hedging, or active portfolio management.
            <br>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3 class="IB3">Risk Management Strategies</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ol class="RM3">
            There are several risk management strategies that can be used by investors in the stock market to mitigate potential risks and maximize returns. Some of the most common risk management strategies in the stock market include:
            <br>
            <br>
            1.    Diversification: Diversification is a strategy that involves spreading investments across different asset classes or securities to reduce the impact of market fluctuations on the portfolio. By investing in a range of stocks across different sectors, geographies, and market capitalizations, investors can minimize the impact of any one stock or sector on the portfolio.
            <br>
            <br>
            2.    Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order is an order to sell a stock if it reaches a certain price point. This strategy is used to limit potential losses in the event that a stock price drops below a predetermined threshold.
            <br>
            <br>
            3.    Hedging: Hedging involves using financial instruments such as options or futures contracts to offset potential losses. For example, an investor might purchase put options on a stock to protect against potential losses if the stock price drops.
            <br>
            <br>
            4.    Active Portfolio Management: Monitoring and altering the portfolio on a constant basis in response to shifting market circumstances is known as active portfolio management. In order to make wise investment selections, this technique requires assessing market trends, corporate performance, and economic data.
